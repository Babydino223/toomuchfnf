Hey! This is basically a lil thing I'm doing where I just recompile pre-existing mods and shove 'em into a Github Page! That might sound familiar, because it exists, but my difference is that
1. I focus on using Kade Engine ports/versions to ensure you can properly load in instead of getting stuck.
2. I plan to have hundreds if this can get large enough!
